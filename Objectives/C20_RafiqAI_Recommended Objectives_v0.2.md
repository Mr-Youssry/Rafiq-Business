# DOHE GO-TOGETHER ACCELERATION PROGRAMME

## RECOMMENDED OBJECTIVES

**Cohort 20 - RAFIQ AI**

---

## Summary

### Background

Rafiq is an emerging AI-powered professional development platform for teachers, designed to make instructional coaching equitable, personalised, scalable, and accessible.

The founding team has deep hands-on experience in teacher training, behaviour change, and instructional coaching, having previously worked directly with educators in schools—primarily in underserved regions such as Egypt and other parts of the Middle East and Africa.

The founders have witnessed that one-on-one instructional coaching works, but it is costly, slow, and inaccessible at national scale. This insight led to Rafiq's core mission:

> **To democratise high-quality teacher coaching and accelerate the spread of effective teaching practices across entire education systems.**

Rafiq is not yet a registered company, and the founders are intentionally delaying registration until they finalise the go-to-market structure, which varies significantly across markets (governments, districts, schools).

The team is currently conducting broad market research across seven countries to validate demand, confirm purchasing pathways, and shape the MVP's features and delivery model.

Rafiq is therefore positioned at a critical early inflection point: moving from insight and coaching expertise into a technology-enabled MVP that can scale far beyond the constraints of in-person support.

## Product & Differentiation

Rafiq is building an AI-driven instructional coaching platform, designed to:

- **Personalise teacher support**
- Provide targeted feedback based on teaching practice
- Help teachers adopt new pedagogical techniques
- Offer structured, evidence-based coaching that scales
- Reduce dependency on expensive, specialist human coaches

The platform aims to replicate the behavioural insights, reflective questioning, and personalised feedback loops typically delivered by organisations like TNTP or high-touch coaching programmes.

### Key Product Components

Key product components described in the transcript include:

- AI-based teacher guidance and feedback
- Personalised coaching pathways
- Evidence-based prompts for classroom improvement
- Insights dashboards for administrators
- Scalable content delivery aligned with international best practice

### Differentiation

Rafiq differentiates itself through:

1. **A coaching-first, not content-first model**
   - The founders emphasise behavioural change, not just delivering modules or videos.

2. **Grounded in real instructional coaching expertise**
   - The product is built on experiences with 1:1 teacher coaching—not generic AI summarisation.

3. **Alignment with system-level needs**
   - The team is designing for ministries, school networks, and districts, not the individual teacher as the sole customer.

4. **Designed for emerging markets**
   - Rafiq's mission prioritises regions with the greatest coaching supply-demand gaps and systemic inequalities.

5. **Human-AI hybrid coaching model**
   - The founders do not intend AI to replace human coaches, but to augment and scale their effectiveness.

## Stage of Growth

**Stage: MVP (Early)**

Rafiq is unequivocally in the MVP stage, not Traction. Clear indicators:

- **No product yet launched:** "we are going to take some time to build the product. once we have an MVP."
- **Not yet a registered company:** "at this point we are not a registered company."
- Still conducting desirability/feasibility/viability research.
- Still validating markets across seven countries.
- Still determining the correct business model (government, district, school).
- No paying users, no recurring revenue, no acquisition channels.

However, they do have strong:

- Domain expertise
- Evidence from real coaching
- Early validation signals from stakeholders
- Clear demand, especially in developing markets

**This places Rafiq at MVP with strong qualitative foundations but no quantified traction yet.**

## Challenges to Date

From the transcript, the core challenges fall into six areas:

### 1. Lack of clarity on the customer (buyer)

Is the buyer:
- The Ministry of Education?
- A district?
- A school?
- A teacher-training organisation?

This is still under investigation.

### 2. Business model still uncertain

The price point, packaging, and monetisation model have not been defined because the buyer type is still undecided.

### 3. Operations and company foundations missing

Registration, policies, privacy, equity, governance structures are not yet in place.

### 4. Product is unbuilt

Only conceptual prototypes exist; AI workflows and user journeys are still being designed.

### 5. No customer insight systems

Although founders have deep coaching knowledge, there is no system to gather, store, and analyse customer interviews at scale.

### 6. No go-to-market strategy

The team is exploring multiple markets but has not chosen the first target segment or country.

### 7. No metrics, KPIs, or definition of success

Nothing is being tracked yet because the product is pre-MVP.

## Recommended Objectives

| Objective | Name | Priority | Rationale |
|-----------|------|----------|-----------|
| **Obj. 2.1** | Validate the Customer Problem | **R1** | Even though the team deeply understands the teacher coaching problem, they do not yet understand the problem from the school district / ministry buyer perspective. The transcript shows uncertainty about the real pain for institutional buyers and what they will pay for. Until the institutional problem is validated in each target market, the MVP might solve a teacher's problem but fail to meet the buyer's. No formal problem validation has been done with institutional buyers in the seven target countries. |
| **Obj. 2.4** | Check the Market Size and Segment | **R1** | Rafiq is currently exploring seven markets, all with different procurement systems and buyer paths. They need to choose the first beachhead segment. Market segmentation defines the MVP scope, pricing, and GTM. Without this, the product will be too broad. Market exploration has begun, but no segment is chosen. |
| **Obj. 3.1** | Help First Users Achieve Real Results | **R1** | When the MVP launches, the first task will be to test if teachers actually improve or experience value from AI-powered coaching. This is foundational: it proves whether the AI coaching model works. No MVP = no user results yet. |
| **Obj. 3.2** | Set Up Basic Product Systems | **R1** | No product systems (feedback collection, feature tracking, QA) currently exist. Core for building and maintaining the MVP. Systems do not exist yet. |
| **Obj. 2.3** | Define and Estimate the Customer Value Proposition | **R2** | The team has coaching expertise but has not defined a crisp value proposition for each buyer type (district / ministry / school). This should crystallise once the problem and market segment decisions occur. Value proposition not yet drafted. |
| **Obj. 2.7** | Test Customer Willingness to Pay Signals | **R2** | No pricing, no LOIs, no pilots, no sponsorship or procurement testing yet. After buyer problem is validated, willingness-to-pay must be tested. No pricing or commitment data exists. |
| **Obj. 1.11** | Establish Core Legal and Compliance Foundations | **R3** | The team is currently not registered at all. This includes no IP ownership, no data privacy, no agreements, no GDPR compliance. Should follow once the company decides on country/market of launch and business model. No legal structure in place. |
