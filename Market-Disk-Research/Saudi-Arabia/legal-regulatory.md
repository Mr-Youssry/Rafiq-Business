# Saudi Arabia - Legal & Regulatory Framework

## Overview

Saudi Arabia has a comprehensive regulatory framework for foreign businesses, data protection, AI governance, and education. The key regulatory bodies are MISA (Ministry of Investment), SDAIA (Saudi Data & AI Authority), and the Ministry of Education.

**Score: 3.5/5**
- Clear, well-defined regulations
- 100% foreign ownership allowed
- Modern data protection and AI governance frameworks
- Complex compliance requirements
- Saudization hiring quotas add operational constraints

## 1. Business Registration & Foreign Investment

### MISA License (Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia)

The MISA License (formerly SAGIA) is required for all foreign companies wishing to legally operate in Saudi Arabia.

#### Key Requirements:
- **100% Foreign Ownership**: Allowed in most sectors without a local partner
- **Minimum Capital**:
  - General LLC: SAR 500,000 (~$133,000)
  - Trading companies: SAR 30 million with commitment to invest SAR 200 million over 5 years
- **Timeline**: 5-7 business days for MISA approval; 8-12 weeks total for full registration
- **Validity**: 1 year, requires renewal

#### Registration Process:
1. Submit application via MISA e-portal
2. Legalize and translate all documents to Arabic
3. Receive Foreign Investment License
4. Register with Ministry of Commerce for Commercial Registration (CR)
5. Register with Chamber of Commerce, ZATCA (tax), and GOSI (social insurance)

#### 2025 Updates:
- New investment law: Companies will register with MISA portal instead of acquiring a license (effective 2025)
- 14,300+ licenses issued in 2024 (67% increase YoY)
- Foreign direct investment inflows rose 44% YoY in Q1 2025

#### EdTech Considerations:
- EdTech classified as education/technology services (eligible for foreign investment)
- If offering remote learning, need appropriate classification
- May need Ministry of Education approval for educational content

**Rafiq AI Implications:**
- Budget SAR 500K minimum capital for MISA registration
- Plan 8-12 weeks for entity setup
- Engage Arabic legal counsel for document translation/legalization
- Consider starting with MISK Accelerator to validate before full entity setup

## 2. Data Protection - PDPL (Personal Data Protection Law)

### Overview
Saudi Arabia's Personal Data Protection Law (Royal Decree M/19) came into force on September 14, 2023, with a one-year grace period (ended September 14, 2024).

### Regulatory Authority
- **SDAIA** supervises and enforces PDPL (first 2 years)
- Will transfer to **National Data Management Office (NDMO)** - a subdivision of SDAIA

### Scope & Extraterritoriality
The PDPL applies to:
- Entities/individuals in Saudi Arabia processing personal data by any means
- **Entities outside Saudi Arabia** processing personal data of individuals located in KSA
- Much broader reach than GDPR (applies to ANY processing, not just offering services)

### 2025 Amendments (Effective March 2025)

#### Expanded Definitions:
- **Personal Data**: Now includes inferred information (purchasing patterns, device fingerprints)
- **Sensitive Data**: Expanded to genetic information and voice patterns
- Organizations must update classification systems accordingly

#### Core Compliance Obligations:

1. **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**:
   - Required if you're a public entity, primary activity is data processing, or processing sensitive data
   - Must be registered on National Data Governance Platform

2. **Registration Requirements**:
   - Controllers must register on National Data Governance Platform if:
     - Public entity
     - Primary activity involves personal data processing
     - Processing sensitive data (health, biometric, criminal records)

3. **Legal Basis for Processing**:
   - Consent (default)
   - Legal obligation
   - Contractual necessity
   - Legitimate interests (excluding sensitive data)

4. **Incident Reporting**:
   - Report qualifying incidents to SDAIA within **72 hours** of discovery
   - Include detailed documentation of compromised data types and mitigation steps
   - Notify affected individuals if breach poses significant risks

5. **Cross-Border Data Transfers**:
   - Requires explicit consent from data subject
   - Receiving country must have adequate protection level
   - NDMO publishes whitelist of approved countries
   - If country not on list, implement additional safeguards

6. **IoT and Device Requirements**:
   - End-to-end encryption required
   - Regular firmware updates
   - Secure authentication protocols
   - Privacy-by-design assessments during product development

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

- **Maximum Fine**: SAR 5 million (~$1.3 million) for severe violations
- **Criminal Penalties**: Up to 2 years imprisonment or SAR 3 million fine for disclosing/publishing sensitive data with intent to harm
- **Repeat Violations**: Fines may be doubled
- **Warnings** issued before fines for first-time offenders

**Rafiq AI Implications:**
- Appoint Data Protection Officer (DPO) - processing teacher performance data likely qualifies as sensitive
- Register on National Data Governance Platform
- Implement 72-hour breach notification procedures
- Teacher video recordings, performance data, and PII require strict controls
- Build consent management for cross-border data transfers
- Consider Saudi data residency (local servers) to simplify compliance
- Privacy-by-design from MVP stage

## 3. AI Governance - SDAIA Regulations

### Overview
Saudi Arabia has one of the most comprehensive AI governance frameworks globally, managed by SDAIA (Saudi Data & AI Authority).

### Key Frameworks

#### 1. AI Adoption Framework (2025)

  - Designers, developers, deployers, implementers, users
  - Public/private entities, non-profits, researchers, institutions
- Pre- and post-conformity assessments required for high-risk AI
- **Prohibited**: AI systems with "unacceptable risk" (social profiling, exploitation of children)

### Risk-Based Approach
- High-risk AI systems (affecting basic rights) undergo conformity assessments
- AI systems with unacceptable risk are prohibited
- Risk levels categorized during development/deployment

### International Recognition
- **OECD AI Recommendation**: Saudi Arabia joined (first international AI standard)
- **Ranked 3rd globally** in OECD's AI Policy Observatory (after US and UK)

- Integrate with existing platforms (Madrasati, iEN) if pursuing government contracts
- Ensure content aligns with Saudi national curriculum and Islamic education values
- May need separate approval process for public vs private school deployments

## 5. Employment & Saudization (Nitaqat Program)
