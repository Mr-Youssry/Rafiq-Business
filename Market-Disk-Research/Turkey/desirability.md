## 2.2 Coaching Adoption

### Current State of Coaching

**Coaching Maturity: Low-Medium**

Unlike the US and UK where instructional coaching is well-established, Turkey has:
- **Limited formal coaching programs**: Most PD is seminar-based
- **Emerging mentoring culture**: E-mentoring programs being piloted
- **Ministry-driven PD**: Centralized in-service training (Hizmet İçi Eğitim)

### TALIS 2024 Data on Türkiye

Key findings from OECD's Teaching and Learning International Survey:

| Indicator | Türkiye | OECD Average | Rank |
|-----------|---------|--------------|------|
| Working hours/week | 31.1 | ~38 | 51/55 (lowest) |
| Average teacher age | 38 years | ~43 | 55/55 (youngest) |
| Teachers 50+ | 7.9% | ~30% | 55/55 (lowest) |
| Contract satisfaction | 50% | ~70% | 51/55 |
| New teacher induction | 56.5% | ~70% | 52/55 |
| Class time on management | 21.5% | ~13% | 2/55 (highest) |

**Key Insights:**
- **Youngest teaching workforce in OECD**: Potentially more tech-receptive
- **Low induction rates**: Gap for onboarding support
- **High classroom management burden**: Teachers need efficiency tools
- **Low contract satisfaction**: Opportunity to add professional value

### Professional Development Structure

**Ministry Programs (Hizmet İçi Eğitim):**
- Centrally organized by MEB
- Short seminars and workshops
- Limited follow-up and coaching
- Research indicates teachers struggle to apply learning alone

**ÖBA Platform:**
- Teacher professional development portal
- Online courses and resources
- Certificate-based completion
- Self-directed, lacks personalized coaching

**Sectoral Excellence Centers:**
- 15 centers for vocational education
- Industry-linked teacher training
- Model for specialized PD

### Teacher Autonomy

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Independent PD choice | Moderate - teachers can select some training |
| Personal budget control | Low - most PD centrally funded |
| Technology adoption | High - teachers can choose supplementary tools |
| After-hours engagement | Moderate - additional learning time available |

**Opportunity:**
Teachers report needing accessible leaders and mentors but often work in isolation after training. AI coaching could fill this support gap.

## 2.3 Investment in Professional Development

### General PD Investment

**Budget Allocation:**
- MEB allocates budget for in-service training
- Exact per-teacher PD spending not publicly reported
- Research indicates insufficient budget allocation
- Private schools invest more in teacher development

**Estimated PD Market:**
- If Turkey spends ~$500/teacher/year on PD (conservative estimate)
- 1.2M teachers × $500 = ~$600M addressable market
- Private school segment likely 3-5x higher per teacher

### Areas of PD Investment

1. **Subject-specific training** (Mathematics, Science, Languages)
2. **Digital literacy and technology integration**
3. **Classroom management**
4. **Inclusive education**
5. **Curriculum updates**

### Coaching-Specific Investment

| Segment | Annual Budget Estimate | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| Public Schools | $100-300/teacher/year | Limited, seminar-focused |
| Private Schools | $500-1,500/teacher/year | More comprehensive |
| International Schools | $1,500-3,000/teacher/year | Closest to Western standards |

**Gap:** Dedicated instructional coaching spending is minimal. Most PD is one-time workshops rather than ongoing coaching relationships.
