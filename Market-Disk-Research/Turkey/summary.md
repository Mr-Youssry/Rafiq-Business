## Recommendation

**CONDITIONAL GO - Secondary Market**

Turkey is a viable market but should be approached as a **secondary expansion market** rather than the primary launch market. The opportunity is real, but the requirement for Turkish localization and local presence adds complexity and investment that may not be justified as a first market.

**When to Pursue Turkey:**
1. After establishing product-market fit in a primary English-speaking market (US, UK)
2. When resources available for Turkish localization ($15K-25K)
3. When ready to build local partnership or hire Turkish-speaking staff
4. If founder has or can develop Turkish network connections

**Immediate Actions (Low Investment):**
1. Attend Education Technologies Summit (February 2025) for market immersion
2. Conduct validation interviews with international schools (English-accessible)
3. Apply to Startupbootcamp Istanbul or KWORKS for network building
4. Monitor Turkish EdTech ecosystem for partnership opportunities

**Risk Level:** Medium
**Reward Potential:** Medium-High (scale possible, lower margins than US/UK)
