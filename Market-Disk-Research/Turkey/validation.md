# Turkey - Strategic Validation

## Section Score: 3/5

Turkey requires targeted validation before full commitment. Key assumptions about coaching demand, willingness to pay, and AI acceptance in Turkish education need testing. The validation approach should focus on international schools first (lower risk) before expanding to the broader Turkish market.

## 5.7 Willingness to Pay Validation

### WTP Testing Approach

**Method 1: Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity**

Ask in interviews:
1. At what price would this be too expensive?
2. At what price would it be so cheap you'd question quality?
3. At what price is it starting to get expensive but still acceptable?
4. At what price is it a bargain?

**Method 2: Direct Pricing Questions**

| Question | Segment |
|----------|---------|
| "What do you currently spend on PD per teacher?" | Baseline |
| "Would you pay $80/teacher/year for this?" | Anchor high |
| "What if it were $50/teacher/year?" | Target price |
| "What would make it worth $100/teacher?" | Feature prioritization |

### WTP Hypotheses

| Segment | Expected WTP | Confidence |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| International Schools | $100-200/teacher | High |
| Premium Private | $60-100/teacher | Medium |
| Standard Private | $40-70/teacher | Medium |
| Individual Teachers | $5-10/month | Low |

### Adjustments Based on WTP Insights

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| WTP < $50 | Add features, reposition value |
| WTP = $50-80 | Proceed with planned pricing |
| WTP > $100 | Consider premium tier |
| Strong individual demand | Invest in freemium marketing |
