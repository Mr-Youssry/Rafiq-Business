**District Customers:**
- Sales cycle: 6-18 months
- Sales rep fully loaded cost: $120K/year
- Sales rep capacity: 20-30 deals/year (given long cycle)
- CAC per district: $4,000-$6,000

- **Total CAC (Individual): $20-$40**

**Lifetime Value (LTV):**

**District Customers:**
- Average contract: $10,000/year
- Retention rate: 85% annually (typical SaaS)
- Average customer lifetime: 6.67 years (1 / (1 - 0.85))
- Gross margin: 80% (high-margin SaaS)
- **LTV (District): $10,000 × 6.67 × 0.80 = $53,360**

**Individual Customers:**
- Average annual revenue: $90/year
- Retention rate: 70% annually (lower than B2B)
- Average customer lifetime: 3.33 years
- Gross margin: 85% (minimal support costs)
- **LTV (Individual): $90 × 3.33 × 0.85 = $255**

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
- **District:** $53,360 / $6,000 = **8.9:1** (Excellent - target is 3:1+)
- **Individual:** $255 / $30 = **8.5:1** (Excellent)

**Payback Period:**
- **District:** $6,000 / ($10,000 × 0.80 / 12) = **9 months** (Good - target <12 months)
- **Individual:** $30 / ($90 × 0.85 / 12) = **4.7 months** (Excellent)

### Gross Margin Analysis

## Break-Even Analysis

### District-Only Model Break-Even

**Assumptions:**
- Average district ACV: $10,000
- Gross margin: 89%
- Fixed costs (lean Year 1): $220K

**Gross Profit per District:** $8,900

**Break-Even Calculation:**
- Fixed Costs / Gross Profit per Unit = Break-Even Units
- $220,000 / $8,900 = **25 districts**

**Revenue at Break-Even:** 25 × $10,000 = **$250,000/year**

**Timeline to Break-Even:**
- Given 6-18 month sales cycles
- Need to close 2-3 deals/month to reach 25 districts in Year 1
- With 1 sales rep (capacity: 20-30 deals/year)
- **Realistic Timeline: 18-24 months to operational break-even**

### Cash Flow Break-Even

**Considerations:**
- Sales cycles mean revenue delayed 6-18 months from start of sales efforts
- Need to fund operations during this period
- CAC paid upfront, revenue recognized over time

**Funding Requirements:**
- Pre-revenue period: 6-12 months
- Ramp to 25 districts: 12-18 months
- **Total cash needed: 18-24 months of runway**

**Cash Required:**
- 24 months × $275K average monthly burn = **$550K-$700K**
- Plus CAC for first 25 districts: 25 × $6,000 = $150K
- **Total Cash to Break-Even: $700K-$850K**

**Seed Round Target:** $1M-$1.5M (provides buffer beyond break-even)

### Path to Profitability

**Year 1:**
- 10 districts, 500 individuals
- Revenue: $95K
- Loss: -$125K to -$295K
- Funded by seed round
