# Legal & Regulatory Environment - USA

## Overview
The United States has a robust but complex regulatory framework for education technology, with both federal laws and state-specific regulations that EdTech companies must navigate. For foreign founders, business formation is straightforward, but compliance requirements are extensive.

## Federal Privacy Laws

### FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)
**Status:** Enacted 1974, actively enforced

**Key Provisions:**
- Protects privacy of students' education records
- Bars disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) in student records to third parties without parental consent
- Applies to all schools and districts receiving federal funding (virtually all public K-12 schools)
- Parents and students 18+ can access records, request changes, and control disclosure

**Implications for Rafiq AI:**
- Must obtain proper consent before accessing student data
- Cannot use student data for commercial purposes (marketing, sales)
- Must have strict data handling protocols
- Schools will require detailed data privacy agreements

**Enforcement:**
- Violations can result in: significant fines, loss of federal funding, disciplinary action from US Department of Education

### COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
**Status:** Enacted 1998, amended 2025

**Key Provisions:**
- Protects privacy of children under 13
- Managed by Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
- Requires parental consent for collection/use of children's personal information
- Applies to websites, online services, apps directed to children

**2025 Updates (Effective April 22, 2025):**
- Expanded definitions of "personal information" and "online contact information"
- New standards for "mixed audience" services
