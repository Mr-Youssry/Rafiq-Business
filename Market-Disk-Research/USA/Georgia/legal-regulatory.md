# Legal & Regulatory Environment - Georgia (USA)

## Overview

Georgia has one of the most comprehensive student data privacy frameworks in the United States. The state's Student Data Privacy, Accessibility, and Transparency Act (SB 89) was praised as "the most comprehensive law of its kind in the nation" at the time of passage. Georgia-based EdTech companies benefit from operating within this robust regulatory environment while adhering to federal requirements (FERPA, COPPA).

## Georgia-Specific Student Privacy Laws

### Student Data Privacy, Accessibility, and Transparency Act (SB 89)

**Status:** Effective July 1, 2016 (O.C.G.A. §20-2-661 – 20-2-667)

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Chief Privacy Officer Requirement:**
   - Georgia Department of Education must designate a senior staff member as Chief Privacy Officer
   - Responsible for establishing and maintaining agency policies and practices
   - Ensures protection of student data at the state level

2. **Data Collection Restrictions:**
   - Restrictions on reporting student data pertaining to juvenile delinquency and criminal records
   - Restrictions on collection of medical/health records
   - Prohibits collection of student political, economic, and religious data

3. **Technology Vendor Requirements:**
   - Must develop security procedures and policies
   - Prohibited from selling personal information about students to advertisers or anyone else
   - Must develop data security training measures
   - Must create protocols for data breach events (notification and remediation)
   - Must establish policies for retention and disposal of personal data

4. **Parental Rights:**
   - Parents have access to their child's data
   - Comprehensive data disclosure requirements

**Why This Matters for Rafiq AI:**
- Georgia's law addresses "all three legs of the stool" - government data, vendor data, and parental access
- Provides clear compliance framework
- Model legislation that influenced other states
- Operating in Georgia provides experience with strict standards that scale nationally

### Protecting Georgia's Children on Social Media Act (SB 351)

- Each local governing body must adopt and enforce a social media policy by April 1, 2025
- Measures to block student access to social media via school-owned devices and networks
- Exceptions for strict educational supervision

**Implications for Rafiq AI:**
- AI coaching platform may need clear educational purpose designation
- Must not be classified as "social media"
- Potential advantage: positioned as professional development tool, not social platform

### Georgia Consumer Privacy Protection Act (Pending)

**Status:** Passed by Senate February 27, 2024; Ready for floor consideration in 2025-2026 Regular Session; Would be effective July 1, 2026 if adopted

- Broader consumer privacy framework
- FERPA-regulated data is exempt (education data carved out)
- Would not add significant new requirements for EdTech beyond existing education-specific laws

## Federal Compliance Requirements
