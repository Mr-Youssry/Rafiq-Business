## Feasibility Assessment

### Can Founders Manage Sales Remotely?

**Yes, with caveats:**

**Advantages:**
- Georgia in Eastern time zone (manageable from most locations)
- Video conferencing widely accepted
- Virtual pilots proven effective post-pandemic
- RESA partnerships can provide local support

**Challenges:**
- Large districts prefer in-person relationships
- Conference attendance important for credibility
- 181 districts = significant outreach volume
- Competing against local/national players with presence

**Recommendation:**
- Start remote, prove product-market fit
- Attend GaETC and 2-3 key events annually
- Hire Atlanta-based rep after seed funding
- Leverage RESAs for local credibility

### Execution Complexity

**Lower Complexity Factors:**
- English-only market
- Clear regulatory framework (SB 89)
- Strong tech infrastructure
- Established EdTech ecosystem

**Higher Complexity Factors:**
- 181 individual districts to sell to
- Long sales cycles (6-18 months)
- Need to build local network from scratch
- Competition from established players

## Overall Feasibility Score: 4/5

### Strengths

- Accessible market from remote (Eastern time, English)
- Strong accelerator/incubator ecosystem
- VC access through Atlanta tech hub
- RESA network provides distribution channel
- GaETC conference offers efficient market access
- Clear compliance framework reduces uncertainty
- State-level coaching initiative creates tailwind

### Challenges

- 181 districts require significant sales effort
- No existing network in Georgia (to be built)
- Local presence eventually needed for large deals
- Competition from established EdTech players
- Long sales cycles typical of K-12

### Verdict

**FEASIBLE WITH INVESTMENT:** Georgia is highly feasible as a market, particularly for a well-funded startup. The combination of the Atlanta tech ecosystem (accelerators, VCs, talent), the RESA distribution network, and the GaETC conference provides efficient market access. Remote sales can work initially, but local presence will accelerate growth. The main challenge is building network from scratch, but the state's welcoming EdTech environment and clear regulatory framework reduce execution risk.

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Attend GaETC 2025 (November 5-7)
2. Build RESA relationships early
3. Secure 2-3 pilot districts in metro Atlanta
4. Consider CREATE-X or ATDC for ecosystem access
5. Plan for Atlanta-based hire post-seed
