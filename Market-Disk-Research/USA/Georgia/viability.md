### Strengths

- Attractive unit economics (6.4:1+ LTV:CAC)
- Large enough market ($4.59M TAM)
- Clear path to $500K+ ARR by Year 3
- Lower break-even than California (smaller market = lower costs)
- Metro Atlanta concentration enables efficient sales
- State coaching initiative creates market awareness

### Challenges

- Lower PD budgets than top-tier states (CA, NY)
- May need to price 10-20% below national average
- Rural districts have limited budgets
- Competition from free state-funded coaching (60 schools)
- Long sales cycles require patience

### Verdict

**VIABLE WITH ADJUSTED EXPECTATIONS:** Georgia offers strong viability as a focused state market. The unit economics are excellent (6.4:1+ LTV:CAC), and the market is large enough to support $2M+ ARR at maturity. Pricing should be adjusted 10-15% below national rates to account for lower Georgia PD budgets. The metro Atlanta concentration enables efficient market development. Georgia can serve as an excellent proving ground for the Southeast region before national expansion.

**Key Financial Milestones:**
- Month 6: 2-3 pilot districts secured
- Month 12: $35K ARR, 3 paying districts
- Month 24: $165K ARR, 12 districts
- Month 36: $500K ARR, 30 districts
