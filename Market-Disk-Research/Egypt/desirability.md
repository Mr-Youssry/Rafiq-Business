## 2.2 Coaching Adoption

### Current State of Instructional Coaching
- **Limited adoption** - Coaching not systematically implemented
- Research on peer coaching limited to isolated studies (single schools)
- Traditional PD programs dominate over coaching models

### Key Research Findings (Cairo School Study)
A study on peer coaching in Egypt identified barriers and opportunities:

**Challenges:**
- Centralized educational system limits autonomy
- Traditional PD program dominance
- Administrative pressures
- Heavy teacher workload
- Difficulty building trust between peer partners

**Ladyshewsky's 5 Aspects of Peer Coaching (assessed):**
1. Establishing peer partners - Challenging
2. Building trust - Major barrier
3. Identifying learning targets - Limited practice
4. Non-evaluative feedback training - Lacking
5. Supporting new ideas - Limited culture

### Professional Development Programs

| Program | Provider | Focus |
|---------|----------|-------|
| TEA (Teach.Engage.Aspire) | British Council + MoE | English teacher CPD, Teacher Activity Groups |
| Teach for Tomorrow | USAID + EDC | CPD linked to promotion, school-based PD |
| EDU 2.0 PD Program | MoE + Discovery Education | Curriculum training, 4,428 teachers surveyed |
| Lesson Study Approach | Research-based | Peer mentoring, communities of practice |

### Teacher Autonomy
- **Low autonomy** - Highly centralized system
- Little flexibility for teachers to engage independently in coaching
- Courses stacked with tasks, leaving little room for innovation
- Teachers often resort to rote teaching due to curriculum burden

### Potential B2C Features for Individual Teachers
Given low autonomy, individual teacher-focused features could include:
- Self-paced micro-learning modules
- Reflection journaling tools
- Peer networking (informal)
- Personal teaching portfolio builder

### Professional Development Budgets
- Teachers generally don't control individual PD budgets
- PD decisions made at school/ministry level
- Some part-time contracts pay as low as $20/month

## 2.3 Investment in Professional Development

### General PD Investment
- **85% of education budget** goes to teacher salaries
- Limited allocation specifically for PD
- Short school year (120 days vs 190 in Scotland) limits PD time
- CPD framework being developed since 2020 with development partners

### National Programs
- EGP 4 billion allocated to hire 160,000 part-time teachers
- EGP 500 million for pre-university education incentives
- $500 million World Bank loan for EDU 2.0 reforms
- ~$124 million in grants from USAID since 2014

### Coaching-Specific Investment
- **No standardized budget** for instructional coaching
- Coaching not widely implemented as formal program
- Research suggests coaching remains in pilot/experimental phase

### Estimated Coaching Budget per Teacher
| Segment | Estimated Annual PD Budget | Notes |
|---------|---------------------------|-------|
| Public Schools | Near zero | Ministry-provided training only |
| Private (mid-tier) | EGP 2,000-5,000 | Variable by school |
| International Schools | EGP 10,000-30,000 | Budget for external training |
