## 3. Go-to-Market Feasibility

### MAT Procurement Model

**Why MATs Make GTM Feasible:**

1. **Centralized Decision-Making:**
   - Single procurement process
   - One contract = 8-92 schools
   - Fewer stakeholders than selling to individual schools
   - Clear decision-makers (CEO, Director of Education, CPD Lead)

2. **Larger Contract Values:**
   - 8-school MAT × 50 teachers/school × £50/teacher = £20K contract
   - 20-school MAT = £50K contract
   - 50-school MAT = £125K contract
   - Enterprise pricing more sustainable than SMB

3. **Efficiency:**
   - One sales cycle → multiple schools
   - One onboarding → trust-wide deployment
   - One success story → larger reference
   - Better unit economics

4. **Government Trend:**
   - All schools → MATs by 2030
   - MATs becoming norm, not exception
   - Future-proofed GTM strategy

**MAT Procurement Reality:**
- Most CPD purchases below £214,904 threshold
- Simplified procurement below threshold
- Many use DfE frameworks (even easier)
- Can direct award from frameworks

**Sales Cycle:**
- 6-12 months for MAT contract
- Longer than individual school BUT
- Much larger contract value
- Better LTV:CAC ratio

**Why Hubs are Feasible GTM:**
1. Early adopters of evidence-based practice
2. Influence multiple schools in network
3. Can pilot and demonstrate impact
4. Create case studies for wider market
5. DfE-connected (credibility)

**Hub Engagement Strategy:**
- Partner with 2-3 hubs for pilot
- Offer ECF-aligned coaching solution
- Create hub-specific case studies
- Leverage hub networks for expansion
