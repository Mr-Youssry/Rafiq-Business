# Legal & Regulatory - United Kingdom

## Overview

The UK presents a moderately complex legal and regulatory environment for EdTech companies, particularly those working with children's data. While company formation is straightforward for foreign founders, data protection compliance requires significant attention and investment.

- EdTech providers must stay current with evolving guidance

### Children's Code (Age Appropriate Design Code)

**Applicability to EdTech**
- EdTech products processing children's personal information may be in scope
- Schools themselves are NOT Information Society Services (ISS) and not in scope

- Cannot rely on school's "public task" lawful basis
- Need own lawful basis for processing
- Additional compliance obligations

**If EdTech Provider is Processor:**
- Acts only on school's instructions

**Joint Controller Scenario:**
- Both parties determine purposes and means
- Requires joint controller agreement
- Shared compliance responsibilities
