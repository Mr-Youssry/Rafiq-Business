# Viability - United Kingdom

## Overview

The UK market presents **moderate to strong viability** for Rafiq AI. While school budgets are under pressure and pricing strategy is critical, the MAT structure, government CPD funding, and established SaaS payment models create viable path to profitability. Success requires competitive pricing, clear ROI demonstration, and efficient customer acquisition.

**Score: 3/5**

## 1. Pricing Landscape

### Current EdTech SaaS Pricing Models

**Per-Pupil Pricing:**

**Per-Teacher Pricing:**
- Professional development tools typically use this
- More relevant for Rafiq AI
- IRIS Connect uses this model (not publicly disclosed)

**School/Site License:**
- Flat fee per school regardless of size
- Predictable for schools
- May leave revenue on table for large schools
- Typical range: £1,000-£5,000/school/year for CPD tools

**MAT Enterprise Pricing:**
- Custom pricing for multi-school trusts
- Based on number of schools and teachers
- Volume discounts expected
- Typical: 10-20% discount for large MATs

### Pricing Challenges in UK EdTech

- Hidden fees emerge later
- Limited flexibility as schools grow/shrink
- Services don't scale well with school data needs

### CPD Budget Benchmarks

**CPD Spending:**
- No fixed percentage of school budget
- Varies widely by school/MAT
- Larger MATs have dedicated CPD budgets
- Early Career Framework (ECF) has dedicated DfE funding

**Government CPD Funding:**

- NPQs: Partially subsidized
- £233M for retention incentives (2024/25)
- £1M for AI tools (2025)
- Teaching School Hubs receive CPD delivery funding

**Typical School CPD Budget:**
- Small primary (200 pupils, 10 teachers): £2K-£5K/year
- Large primary (600 pupils, 25 teachers): £5K-£10K/year
- Secondary (1000 pupils, 80 teachers): £15K-£40K/year
- Large secondary (1500+ pupils, 120 teachers): £30K-£60K/year

**MAT CPD Budgets:**
- Small MAT (5 schools, 200 teachers): £30K-£60K/year

## 6. Risks to Viability

### Revenue Risks

**1. Budget Constraints**
- **Risk:** Schools defer EdTech purchases due to budget pressure
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (slower sales)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strong ROI demonstration (time savings = money saved)
  - Free pilots to prove value
  - Flexible payment terms (quarterly vs annual)
  - Emphasize teacher retention savings (£30K to replace teacher)

**2. Pricing Pressure from IRIS Connect**
- **Risk:** IRIS Connect matches or undercuts pricing
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Differentiate on AI-first capabilities
  - Better workload reduction metrics
  - Faster product iteration
  - Superior user experience

**3. Low Renewal Rates**
- **Risk:** Customers don't renew after Year 1
- **Likelihood:** Low (if product works)
- **Impact:** High (unit economics break)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Dedicated customer success
  - Regular check-ins and training
  - Demonstrate ongoing impact
  - Product improvements based on feedback
  - Multi-year contracts with discount

**4. Longer Sales Cycles Than Expected**
- **Risk:** MAT procurement takes 12+ months, not 6
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (delays revenue)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build 18-month pipeline
  - Offer quick-start pilots (3 months)
  - Target September start dates (plan backwards)
  - Individual school licenses for faster revenue

### Cost Risks

**1. Higher CAC Than Projected**
- **Risk:** Costs £50K-£60K to acquire MAT, not £30K
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (extends runway to profitability)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Content marketing to reduce paid acquisition
  - Referrals from existing customers (incentivize)
  - Teaching School Hub partnerships (lower CAC channel)
  - Word of mouth in MAT networks

**2. Compliance Costs**
- **Risk:** GDPR, data protection costs higher than £20K-£25K
- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Budget conservatively
  - Outsource DPO initially
  - Use compliance platforms (automation)

**3. Infrastructure Costs**
- **Risk:** AI API costs (OpenAI, etc.) higher than projected
- **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on usage)
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Price based on usage tier limits
  - Optimize prompts for cost
  - Consider fine-tuned models (lower per-call cost)
  - Monitor and cap usage

### Market Risks

**1. Government Policy Changes**
- **Risk:** CPD funding cuts, MAT policy reversal
- **Likelihood:** Low (cross-party support for teacher development)
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Diversify value proposition (not just ECF)
  - Serve both MATs and individual schools
  - Build into school culture (hard to remove)

**2. Economic Downturn**
- **Risk:** UK recession, education budget cuts
- **Likelihood:** Medium (global economic uncertainty)
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Emphasize cost savings (cheaper than human coaching)
  - Teacher retention ROI (saves £30K+ per prevented resignation)
  - Efficiency narrative (do more with less)

## Conclusion

The UK market scores **3/5 for Viability** due to:

**Strengths:**
- Clear pricing benchmarks (IRIS Connect, CPD market)
- MAT budgets support £25K-£100K contracts
- Government funding for CPD (ECF, retention incentives)
- Strong unit economics possible (LTV:CAC 3.3:1)
- Path to profitability by Year 3 (£1.17M ARR break-even)

**Challenges:**
- School budgets under pressure (lower than 2019)
- Pricing is #1 challenge for 60% of EdTech startups
- Must prove clear ROI to overcome budget constraints
- Competition from IRIS Connect on pricing

**Mitigations:**
- Competitive pricing (20-30% below IRIS Connect)
- Strong value prop (6 hours/week saved = £3K-£4K value)
- Teacher retention ROI (saves £30K per prevented resignation)
- Flexible packaging (school, MAT, individual)

**Bottom Line:** Viability is achievable but requires careful execution. Pricing must be competitive yet sustainable. Strong ROI demonstration and efficient customer acquisition are critical. Path to profitability exists (Year 3) with reasonable assumptions and proper funding (Emerge Education seed round).

**Key Success Factor:** Demonstrate quantifiable time savings and teacher retention impact. If schools see 6 hours/week saved, £50/teacher/year is easy justification.
